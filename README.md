# nuke_anything_reloaded
Chrome extension that allows you to hide almost anything via context menu.

Inspired by "Nuke anything (Enhanced)" addon for Firefox. Sadly I could not find anything like it for Chrome (or newer FF version).

Maybe I can find a way to add the visual to see the object to be removed that the FF version has. but for now it just works :)
